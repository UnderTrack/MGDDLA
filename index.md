# Monster Girl Dreams Discord Lore Archive

[**Monster Girl Dreams**](https://monstergirldreams.blogspot.com/p/about.html) is a 18+ game that can better be described as a battle-fuck RPG.
Being currently in development at its slow pace, the active discord community does quite a lot in [there](https://discord.com/invite/monstergirldreams).
In particular, `#mgd-nonsense` is reputable for being hard to follow. Indeed while that channel's community is rather small, interactions are numerous, complex and trace back an rather long time.
Thus I, ~~as Underen~~, hereby declare this archive open, for y'all memers to have an easier understanding of our madness. :^)

Page's on github so that people of the community can more easily add more content.
*I am new with gitpages, alltho don't worry, it can be daunting but it's actualy rather easy. The styling is automatic and uses tags primarly based in Markdown, the same as the one discord uses so you shouldn't be too lost. If you want to contribute to the project, you can just go to the github of the side and edit/add things. Just make sure if you add a new page to the site, that the file's extension is `.md`*. If you ever have a doubt about how to write/display something, check out the code in the [theme's demo page code](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight/edit/master/index.md) of which you can see the results [there](https://pages-themes.github.io/midnight/). 

# Ongoing Lore

## Survey Strikes back - Kotone debate v2 ?
After surveys on monstergirl tastes, they return with *November* doing a survey that is actualy a court trial of Kotone. With a poor realisation, his trial is discredited and due to starting a "Kotone debate", he even had to file a notice against himself.

## *November*'s Ancilla Notices
*November* has started making penalty notes on people, most notably *Hoot* for awooing, with over a couple dozen notice filed, he keeps track of how the community behaves, incarnating Ancilla.

# Past Lore
Here's the collection of past events in the `#mgd-nonsense` lore. Ordered in descending chronological order (ei. most recent first and gets older as you scroll down).

## Science Team - Stat nerds go mad ? 
### Part 2 - Surveys > Tierlists ?
- 10 Octo. 2022 to 20 Octo. 2022
Compensating from the lack of data of tierlists to make correlation, the first survey emerged from *Burner*. It was using a simple 7 level likert scale on wether or not you liked a given character. This was followed by a more complete survey from *November-38*, which used a more contrained 5 level likert scale but diversified questions with a question on the character's art and appearance, the character's personality, the character's content and the character's fetishes. To complement those, *November* introduced a nice pair of questions, firstly an unique answer on whom was the personal favourite character and another one where the person would say to which degree of a relationship he/she's willing to go with the monstergirl.
With much delay and unsatisfied by the lack of data and contraints of the 2 existing surveys, *Underen* followed suit with the most furnished be-all-end-all survey. Taking an hour to complete on average, the survey used a 9 level likert scale asking on the people's taste of art style/quality, appearance, personality, sexual content, non sexual content, fetish covering as well as asking a similar question about relationship as *November*'s but more detailed, with a difference between relational and sexual interests being accounted and a wide range of relation levels accounted, including a negative one.
The survey trend however, was at the end of the data hype and while *Underen*'s survey was providing for nice data, people weren't as motivate to answer it than making tierlists, leading to a currently twice lower number of survey answers on *Underen*'s (24) than compiled tierlists and even less on *November*'s and *Burner*'s surveys.
Survey results however still yeild better results as the data offers a lot more indept detail over people's personal and monstergirl tastes. The data still suffers from bias due to the low number of answers but allows for a more indepth look at the tastes, and what exactly people like or dislike about certain girls and to which degree. It also helps in making more accurate correlations between people.

### Part 1 - Tierlists Compilation
- 14 Sept. 2022 to 4 Octo. 2022
Following the Labyrinth and new Mimic updates, doing monstergirl tierlists saw a resurgence in `#mgd-nonsense`. Benefiting from this and the recent debacle, *Nathan* decided to compile tierlists in order to figure out which girls were actualy better. *Nathan*, however never got to share any results, perhaps his researches on the matter never truely started as he spent most of the time with Kotone.
This gave inspiration for *Swagmc* and later *Cob* to start there own research on the matter. The results were nice but the nerds were looking for new ways to use that dat including comparing tastes and looking at who was agreeing with whom most. This continued for quite a while as the gathering of tierlist was long, the exact way one was supposed to interpret tiers was also complicated.
Overall, *Cob*'s and *Swag*'s  work confirmed that Vili and Tabitha were best girls, alltho for people agreeing, stat nerds judged tierlists insufficient.
Nerds in question being *Swag*, *Burner*, *November*, *Hoot* and *Underen*; which discussed various ways to maths things in a representative manner, be it different scales or which parameters to use to quantify agreement with primary means being Standard Deviation as well as Pearson's Linear Correlation Coefficient.

## Human Research Facility - A New SCP Center ?
- 7 Sept. 2022,
Headed by *XaviScarlet*, a research center is founded in Lucidia, its goal is simple: study the local monstergirls.
While the exact structure of the fundation is not exactly clear, at its head was actualy a board directorate, *Xavi* heading it, the board itslef included several other people, most notably *Dalion* and *UsRnx*.
The facility is known for its Mofu specialist: *Nathan*. Suffering from a severe mofu addiction, *Nathan*'s researches were nearly halted by the facility as his reports on the effect of mofu on mankind were useless. Indeed the poor man was mostly writing "mofu" and his budget was massive leading to *Dalion* and *Xavi* facing him with either being deported from research on Kotone or fixing his work. However while his searches continued, *Nathan* progressed independantly from the facility.
*Dark Wing* is another employee of the facility, with much more subtle activities including researches on Jora and Beris.
